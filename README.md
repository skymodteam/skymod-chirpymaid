# skymod-chirpymaid

A simple Cities: Skylines mod that adds a "Clear Everything" button to the Chirper. Tired of your Cims complaining? Forget to check the Chirper and now you have 100+ messages to go through? Fear not! This mod will add a "CE" button to your Chirper panel so you can ignore all of your Cims!

## How to Build

1. Clone the source.
2. Open in Visual Studio (tested on 2013).
3. Add the game assembly path to the project reference paths.
  1. The path is `[SteamLibrary]\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Cities_Data\Managed`, where `[SteamLibrary]` is your Steam library folder.
4. Build.

## What if I just want the mod to install it?
